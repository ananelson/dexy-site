<h1>Linewise</h1>

<p>The linewise handler lets you run code line-by-line in an interpreter and capture the echoed input and the resulting output. Many other classes subclass the linewise handler to take advantage of this functionality. The linewise handler happens to serve as the Python transcript handler too.</p>

<p>This is some Python:</p>
{{ d['example.py|pyg'] }}

This Python code is divided into sections using Idiopidae comments.

<h3>Linewise</h3>
<p>You can run the code without worrying about sections, in this case everything is treated as 1 section.</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example.py|pycon|pyg'] }}
</pre>

Or you can run the code through the <a href="/docs/filters/idio/">idio</a> filter first, and then the sectionwise handler will preserve these sections while processing the script.

Here is the first section, called "initialize-vars":
<pre>
{{ d['sections']['example.py|idio|pycon|pyg']['initialize-vars'] }}
</pre>

Here is the second section, called "do-stuff":
<pre>
{{ d['sections']['example.py|idio|pycon|pyg']['do-stuff'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is the source of the handler:</p>
{{ d['sections']['subprocess_handler.py|idio']['linewise'] }}

<h3>Dexy Specification</h3>
<p>Here is how to specify this:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['.dexy|dexy'] }}
</pre>

<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Here is the source of this document:</p>
{{ d['index.html|pyg'] }}
