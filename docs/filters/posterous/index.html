<h1>Posterous</h1>

<p>The Posterous handler does work basically, although unfortunately Posterous's API strips out all syntax highlighting. There is a built-in syntax highlighter which requires you to mark chunks of code with the language, it should be possible to automate this language tagging (if posterous supports your choice of language), so in theory you could do code blogging using dexy with your posterous blog. Please let me know if this is an important feature.</p>
