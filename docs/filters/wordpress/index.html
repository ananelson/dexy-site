<h1>WordPress</h1>

<p>WordPress is the most well-supported blogging platform at the moment, it's used for Dexy's own blog. This handler should work with both self-hosted WordPress and wordpress.com blogs. For syntax highlighting, you can either add a stylesheet to your blog's theme, or you can use <a href="/docs/filters/inlinecss">css inlining</a> which doesn't require a custom stylesheet. For examples of how to use this, look at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ananelson/dexy-blog/wiki/Home">dexy blog source</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the source of the WordPress handler, which inherits from the <a href="/docs/filters/blogging">blogging</a> handler:</p>
