<h1>Idiopidae</h1>

<p>Idiopidae is a library which splits a code file into sections based on specially formatted comments in the code. Idiopidae will also syntax highlight the code.</p>

<p>This is some python code:</p>
{{ d['example.py|pyg'] }}

<p>When we run it through the idiopidae, the code is split into sections named "initialize-vars" and "do-stuff".</p>

<p>initialize-vars:</p>
{{ d['example.py|idio']['initialize-vars'] }}

<p>do-stuff</p>
{{ d['example.py|idio']['do-stuff'] }}

<p>Many Dexy filters are written so as to preserve this sectioning when they operate on the text. This preservation will also work if you devise a different way of splitting up your code code into sections.</p>
