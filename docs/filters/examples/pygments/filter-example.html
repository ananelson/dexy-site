<p><a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a> is a syntax highlighting library.
Pygments has a large number of <a href="http://pygments.org/languages/">supported languages</a>
and can handle complex lexing challenges. Pygments is installed along with Dexy
so you can use the Pygments filter right away.</p>

<p>This is some python code:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example1.py'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is this code with pygments syntax highlighting applied:</p>
{{ d['example1.py|pyg'] }}

<p>You can pass any of <a href="http://pygments.org/docs/formatters/">these options</a>
to the pygments formatter by passing a dict of key/value pairs with the name
'pygments' (see examples below). You need to write the option values in JSON
format, main thing to watch out for is that booleans are lower case rather than
title case as in Python.</p>

<p>Pygments supports creating anchors for each line of text, letting you link
directly to a particular line of code on a page. Dexy's pygments filter
automatically configures line anchors using the document's key, this ensures
unique anchors if you have code from two different documents on a page. You can
set "lineanchors" to something else to override this, set it to an empty string
to disable anchors. Anchors are separate from line numbers, you can enable
visible line numbers via the "linenos" option, and you can make line numbers
clickable links to their respective anchors via the "anchorlinenos" option.
Consult the <a href="http://pygments.org/docs/formatters">pygments formatter option documentation</a>
for details on these and other options.</p>

<p>Here is this code with line numbers:</p>
{{ d['example2.py|pyg'] }}

<p>And now with clickable line number anchor links, a simpler custom lineanchor
setting, and inline styles using a different stylesheet:</p>
{{ d['example3.py|pyg'] }}

<p>The above examples show Pygments outputting HTML, the default, but Pygments
can also output LaTeX formatting codes, SVG and image files (if PIL is
installed). You can use the ForceXExtensionFilter family to force Pygments to
output different formats.</p>

<p>For example, here is some LaTeX markup:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example3.py|pyg|l'] }}
</pre>

<p>And here is SVG rendering of the source code:</p>
<div style="width:100px; height: 110px;">
{{ d['example3.py|pyg|svg'] }}
</div>

<p>And here is a PNG image:</p>
<img src="examples/pygments/example3.png" />
<br />

<p>Pygments uses file extensions to figure out what language's lexer to apply
to your code. Most of the time it does a good job, but sometimes this approach
doesn't work. You can now specify the lexer to use in your .dexy file. This
allows you to use a different file extension than the one Pygments has
associated with the lexer, and to highlight languages where there is no
designated file extension.</p>

<p>For example, here is a highlighted Sqlite3 console session (from
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html">here</a>) saved in a file with a
.txt extension:</p>

{{ d['example.txt|pyg'] }}

<p>For HTML and LaTeX output, you can generate stylesheets using the
<code>pygmentize</code> command line tool, but there are some shortcuts for this in dexy.</p>

<p>You can now create a pygments stylesheet by specifying an empty virtual file with .css or .sty extension and passing this through the pygments filter (see .dexy config - virtual files begin with an '@). You can specify the pygments style to use. The generated file is linked {{ a['pygments.css|pyg'].hyperlink('here') }}.</p>

<p>You can also include style definitions directly from jinja. You can just type:</p>

<pre>
{{ "{{ pygments['pastie.css'] }}" }}
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
{{ "<< pygments['pastie.tex'] >>" }}
</pre>

<p>to insert the style definitions for the 'pastie' style in your document. The
'pygments' object is just a dict and should contain entries for all the
pygments styles.</p>
