<h2>Pygments Example</h2>

<p>Pygments is a <a href="http://pygments.org">syntax highlighting library</a>. For now it's the only one implemented for Dexy, as it has an amazing number of supported languages and a very solid parser so it's very robust, especially with complex situations like Ruby code embedded in a Ragel parser. Of course more syntax highlighters will be added to Dexy in the future and if you need a particular one now then shout (or DIY and send us a patch).</p>

<p>This is some python code:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example.py|dexy'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is this code with pygments syntax highlighting applied:</p>
{{ d['example.py|pyg'] }}
