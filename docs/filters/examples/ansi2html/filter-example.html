<p>Here is HTML with color codes generated by calling bash `ls`:</p>

{{ d['out.txt|ansi2html'] }}

<p>You can create a stylesheet by specifing a blank virtual file with css extension (see .dexy config, virtual files start with an @), and passing this through the ansi2html filter. An example of a generated CSS file is {{ a['ansi2html.css|ansi2html'].hyperlink('here') }}.</p>
