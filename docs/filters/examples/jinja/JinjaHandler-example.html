<h2>Jinja Handler</h2>

<p>Jinja is a very important Dexy filter. <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> is a templating framework, which is what allows you to create dynamic documents in Dexy. Eventually Dexy will support several templating frameworks (like <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">mako</a>, Erb, etc. and many others), but to start with we have chosen Jinja while we work out the best way to work with templating.</p>

<p>Here is a simple text file with some jinja tags.</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example.txt|dexy'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is this same text file after jinja processing.</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example.txt|jinja'] }}
</pre>
