<p>Here is some C code:</p>

{{ d['001f.c|pyg'] }}

<p>This filter compiles and runs this code, returning the output:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['001f.c|cfussy'] }}
</pre>

<p>This filter is called 'fussy' because it raises an exception if your C code returns a nonzero exit status.</p>

<p>For example, this code does not return 0:</p>

{{ d['001.c|pyg'] }}

<p>The cfussy filter will raise an exception if this code is run, unless you instruct Dexy to ignore nonzero exit codes. In this case a warning will be written to the log file:</p>

<pre>
{{ a['001.c|cfussy'].logstream }}
</pre>
