<p>The 'sed' filter will run sed commands on input text. To start with, you write a .sed file containing the commands you wish to run:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['example.sed'] }}
</pre>

<p>Then you prepare a text file with the content you would like to transform with sed:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['input.txt'] }}
</pre>

<p>You need to set the text file as an input, you can see how this is done in the config file below (see the <a href="/docs/filters/pyinput">Python input filter example</a> for how to run multiple inputs).</p>

<p>Here is the output when run:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['example.sed|sed'] }}
</pre>

<p>If you have a really short script, then you might want to create a virtual file and just enter the contents in the .dexy config file below. This is faster, the down side is that it's a little harder to include your original sed script in your document, although it's still possible:</p>
<pre>
{{ a['virtual.sed|sed'].input_text() }}
</pre>

<p>You get the same result from a virtual file:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['virtual.sed|sed'] }}
</pre>
