<p>The fn filter helps us share data between different files. The fn filter
looks for files with names starting with <code>dexy--</code> and it replaces
these with a special hashcode filename.</p>

<p>Here is a Python file that creates a new file:</p>

{{ d['file1.py|pyg'] }}

<p>It is an error if the first file to mention a file doesn't actually create the file. We can see that when the script is run, the filename has been replaced:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['file1.py|fn|pycon'] }}
</pre>

<p>We can pull the created file directly into documents:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['data-file-1.txt'] }}
</pre>

<p>The second python script reads the first data file, and creates a second one:</p>

{{ d['file2.py|pyg'] }}

<pre>
{{ d['file2.py|fn|pycon'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is the data file:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['data-file-2.txt'] }}
</pre>
