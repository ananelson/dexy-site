<p>Here is some python code</p>

{{ d['example.py|pyg'] }}

<p>Here is the output when run:</p>

<pre>
{{ d['example.py|pycon'] }}
</pre>

<p>We can also syntax highlight the repl transcript:</p>
{{ d['example.py|pycon|pyg'] }}

<p>We have the option to save variables to a JSON file where we can use them in documents. In this script x was {{ d['example-save-vars.py|pycon-vars']['x'] }} and y was {{ d['example-save-vars.py|pycon-vars']['y'] }}.</p>
