To create examples for a filter, make a directory named like a filter alias.

e.g. to create examples for the rhino filter, we will create a folder called rhino

To create multiple examples for a single filter, make additional directories which start with the alias name

The example description should be a file named filter-example.html

Create as many example scripts as desired and create a .dexy file for the directory.

filter-example.html does not needt o be listed in this .dexy file, it is already specified in a higher level file
