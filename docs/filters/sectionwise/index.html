<h1>Sectionwise</h1>

The Sectionwise handler lets you run code in sections. Many other classes subclass the Sectionwise handler to take advantage of this functionality. The Sectionwise handler happens to serve as the R transcript handler too.

<p>This is some R:</p>
{{ d['example.R|pyg'] }}

This R code is divided into sections using Idiopidae comments.

<h3>Sectionwise</h3>
<p>You can run the code without worrying about sections, in this case everything is treated as 1 section.</p>
<pre>
{{ d['example.R|rint|pyg'] }}
</pre>

Or you can run the code through the <a href="/docs/filters/idio/">idio</a> filter first, and then the sectionwise handler will preserve these sections while processing the script.

Here is the first section, called "initialize-vars":
<pre>
{{ d['sections']['example.R|idio|rint|pyg']['initialize-vars'] }}
</pre>

Here is the second section, called "do-stuff":
<pre>
{{ d['sections']['example.R|idio|rint|pyg']['do-stuff'] }}
</pre>

<p>Here is the source of the handler:</p>
{{ d['sections']['subprocess_handler.py|idio']['sectionwise'] }}

<h3>Dexy Specification</h3>
<p>Here is how to specify this:</p>
<pre>
{{ d['.dexy|dexy'] }}
</pre>
