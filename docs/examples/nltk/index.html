<p>This is some messing around with the prototype <a href="/docs/filters/nltk">NLTK filter</a>,
a Dexy filter making use of the <a href="http://nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</a>
to do some simple text processing.</p>

<p>The text of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf">Beowulf</a>
[ab]used here is <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/981">this one</a> on
Project Gutenberg, although there are several other editions on there too.
To learn more about Beowulf and the history of English, check out some of
<a href="http://michaeldrout.com/">this guy's</a> excellent lectures.</p>

<p>The text has {{ d['beowulf.txt|nltk']['wc'] }} words.</p>

<p>Here are some collocations found in the text:</p>

<pre>
{% for w1, w2 in d['beowulf.txt|nltk']['collocations'] -%}
{{ w1 }} {{ w2 }}
{% endfor -%}
</pre>
<br />

<p>Here is the start of the full text, annotated with parts of speech and
utterly arbitrary syntax highlighting:</p>

<p>{% for word, pos in d['beowulf.txt|nltk']['pos-tags'][0:500] -%}
<span class="pos-{{ pos }}" title="part of speech for {{ word}} is {{ pos }}">{{ word }}</span> {% endfor -%}...</p>
