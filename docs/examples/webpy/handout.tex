\section{About}
More information about Dexy is available at \url{http://dexy.it}. You can follow the project @dexyit on twitter or the author @ananelson. Dexy is open source software to make you and your docs awesome. Check it out!

\section{Watir Script}

Here is the full selenium script we run:

<< d['take-screenshots.py|pyg|l'] >>

You should see a page like this when you visit your site:

\section{Developer Docs}

We can mix and match various elements into developer docs, depending on how we want these docs to support developer workflows. For example, we can show code:
\scriptsize
<< d['model.py|pyg|l'] >>
\normalsize

and we can show screenshots next to the code which generated those screenshots:
\scriptsize
<< d['take-screenshots.py|idio|l']['enter-text'] >>
\normalsize

It's probably a good idea to have the developer docs incorporate the elements from the user guide, along with extra information relevant to developers. This means that developers have a chance to spot problems with the user guide as they are using the same information.

This could be as simple as having the same source generate the user guide and the developer docs, with an option whether to show the code or not. In this way if the human language instructions diverge from the actions taken by the script, this will be apparent to developers. It may be possible to have the human language instructions be generated from the script, or to use a system like Cucumber which will make it very explicit what the code should be doing.

\section{User Guide}

In our user guide, we can tell people what steps they should take and show them how it should look. Here is a tongue-in-cheek example of how you might incorporate screenshots into a user guide:
