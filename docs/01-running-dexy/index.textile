In this tutorial we install Dexy and explore the command-line tool. We write a simple configuration file and run it to see what happens. After you finish this tutorial then you'll be ready to go on to the next one, where we actually create our first document with Dexy.

Dexy has not yet been tested on Windows, and at least 1 library it depends on is Windows-compatible. We're working to make Dexy work with Windows, but in the mean time you can run Dexy within a virtual machine running Linux. Even if you are on OSX or Linux it might make sense to run Dexy in a virtual machine as this way you won't mess up your system.

In order to install Dexy, you need to install Python and easy_install. Download the Dexy source or use Mercurial to obtain a copy of the repository, then use easy_install to install Dexy and all dependencies. On Ubuntu Lucid which already has Python 2.6 installed, the following script should do the trick:

<notextile>
{% if is_latex %}
{{ d['install.sh|pyg|l'] }}
{% else %}
{{ d['install.sh|pyg'] }}
{% endif %}
</notextile>
