<p>This is a template for a simple python code journal, written in html, demonstrating how to use numpy and matplotlib and include matplotlib graphs.</p>

<p>The 'template.html' file contains your content. The _header.html file takes care of doctypes and CSS, and the _footer.html file closes the HTML tags that _header.html opens, so you don't need to worry about that (the 'hd' and 'ft' filters are what apply the header and footer to your file). If you get tired of typing &lt;p&gt; tags, you can also <a href="/docs/templates/code-journal-markdown-python-matplotlib/">write your journal in markdown</a>.</p>

<p>This template uses the <a href="http://atatonic.timbenniks.nl/">atatonic</a> web framework to give nice typography and a simple, clean look.</p>
