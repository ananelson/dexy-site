<p>This is a template for a simple python code journal, written in HTML.</p>

<p>The 'template.html' file contains your content. The _header.html file takes care of doctypes and CSS, and the _footer.html file closes the HTML tags that _header.html opens, so you don't need to worry about that (the 'hd' and 'ft' filters are what apply the header and footer to your file). If you get bored writing paragraph tags, you can also <a href="/docs/templates/code-journal-markdown-python/">write your journal in markdown</a>.</p>

<p>This template uses the <a href="http://atatonic.timbenniks.nl/">atatonic</a> web framework to give nice typography and a simple, clean look.</p>
