This is a guide to writing template-based documents using Dexy. We will cover
the template plugin system, and when to think about writing a custom plugin or
a custom filter.

A template system, such as Jinja or Ruby's ERB, lets you insert dynamic content into
your documents. The string interpolation found in many programming languages
can also act as a templating system.

In fact, the default templating filter for Dexy uses Python string interpolation.
