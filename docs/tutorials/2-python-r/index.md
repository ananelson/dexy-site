You need the garlicsim and garlicsim_lib Python packages installed for this tutorial. You also need R installed and the "rjson" package installed within R.

We are going to run a Python script to generate some data, then run R to analyze that data and (eventually) make some graphs.

Here is the [Python script](00/run-prisoner.py):

{{ d['00/run-prisoner.py|pyg'] }}
{{ clippy_helper(d['00/run-prisoner.py']) }}

You can run this from the command line and it should generate a CSV and JSON file containing the data generated by the simulation.

Here is the [R script](00/prisoner.R):

{{ d['00/prisoner.R|pyg'] }}
{{ clippy_helper(d['00/prisoner.R']) }}

If you run this (AFTER you run the python script) you should get some PNGs and another JSON file.

However, we don't want to have to run these files manually and in the correct order, and we also don't want the generated files cluttering up our workspace.

Dexy has a random filename generator. It looks for filenames starting with <code>dexy--</code> and it generates a random filename which is different each time you run Dexy.

In order for prisoner.R to have access to the random filenames generated for run-prisoner.py, we need to have run-prisoner.py as an input to prisoner.R.

Here is the .dexy file:

{{ pre_and_clippy(d['01/.dexy']) }}

Here is how you might write a HTML file to show these:

{{ d['01/doc.html|pyg'] }}
{{ clippy_helper(d['01/doc.html']) }}
