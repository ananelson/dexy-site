## Dexy for Agile Reporting & Documentation

How can documentation keep up with an agile development process? The answer is to make documentation an integral part of the process, just like you do with testing. Dexy is a developer-friendly documentation tool which helps you automate the integration of code into your documentation.

Starting with developer documentation is a great way to get the whole team involved in documentation and, with an automated approach, the ingredients for the developer docs can be remixed to form the basis of other documentation. End-user-facing screenshots can be automatically generated by a script which also does integration testing, so your documentation is easy and fast to update, and you can trust that it's still correct since it's backed by tests. Scripts find your documentation bugs, not your users.

Dexy supports a wide variety of document formats and can integrate with APIs to publish your docs automatically. Dexy also supports many different programming languages, so you can have side-by-side examples for all your API libraries, and you can document the bash scripts, SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS that's part of your project as well as the primary back-end language.

Once your project is out in the wild, you can also use Dexy as an automated reporting tool to generate traffic analytics reports or to analyze the data gathered by your app.
