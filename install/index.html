<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

<p>Dexy is written in pure Python, and uses Setuptools. Dexy should be very simple to install. Many of Dexy's filters depend on having other software installed, so depending on how you want to use Dexy you might need to install some extra software too. For example, if you want to use the latex filter to turn documents written in LaTeX into PDFs, then you'll need to install TeXLive or a similar package.</p>

<p>Dexy should work on Python 2.6 or Python 2.7. There is no support for Python 3.0 yet.</p>

<p>If you run into issues with this install process then <a href="http://discuss.dexy.it">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>Dexy's source code is available either from <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ananelson/dexy">bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://github.com/ananelson/dexy">github</a>.</p>

<h2>Easy Install</h2>

<p>The recommended way to install Dexy is using either pip or easy_install (which is part of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>).</p>

{{ d['sections']['source-install.sh|idio']['source-install'] }}

<p>You can upgrade your Dexy by calling easy_install with the --upgrade flag. There are various other tools available to help with Python package management that you might also use, instead of or in addition to easy_install. Check out <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk/">yolk</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>,and <a href="http://virtualenv.openplans.org/">virtualenv</a>.

<h2>Checking That It Works</h2>

<p>Regardless of which method you use, you can make sure it works by typing:</p>

{{ d['sections']['source-install.sh|idio']['dexy-help'] }}


<p>Once you have Dexy installed, you can start working through the <a href="/docs/tutorials">tutorials</a>.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>Dexy should install on Windows using easy_install, however not all the filters will work on Windows. The dexy.log file should provide clues.</p>

<h2 id="nosudo">Install Without Sudo</h2>

<p>Here is an example using <a href="http://virtualenv.openplans.org/">virtualenv</a> to create a local self-contained install of Dexy without requiring root access.</p>
